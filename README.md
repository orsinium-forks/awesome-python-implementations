# Awesome Python Implementations

## Mainstream implementations

- [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) ★53573 - The reference implementation of Python, written in C.
- [PyPy](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy) - Python in Python, includes a tracing JIT compiler.
- [IronPython](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3) ★2135 - Python in C# for the Common Language Runtime (CLR/.NET).
- [GraalPython](https://github.com/oracle/graalpython) ★979 - Python in Java, using the Graal just-in-time compiler and the Truffle interpreter implementation framework
- [Jython](https://github.com/jython/jython) ★867 - Python in Java for the Java platform.

## Lightweight implementations

Mainly for embedded systems.

- [Micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) ★16658 - Python for microcontrollers
- [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) ★3549 - Python for microcontrollers

### Dead projects

- [Pymite](https://github.com/giuseppebarba/pymite) ★4 - Python-on-a-Chip (p14p) is a project to develop a reduced Python virtual machine (codenamed PyMite) that runs a significant subset of the Python 2.6 language on microcontrollers without an OS.

## Python to JavaScript transpilers

### Active projects

- [Brython](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython) ★6026 - a way to run Python in the browser through translation to JS
- [pyjs](https://github.com/pyjs/pyjs) ★1122 - (formerly Pyjamas) a Python to JS compiler plus Web/GUI framework
- [Transcrypt](http://www.transcrypt.org/) - Python 3.6 to JS precompiler with lean and fast generated code, sourcemaps, built-in minification, optional static type-checking, JSX support

### Dead projects

- [Pyjaco](https://github.com/chrivers/pyjaco) ★141 - Similar to Pyjs but more lightweight
